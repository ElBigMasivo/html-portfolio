<h1>About Me</h1>
 <p>Welcome to my website where you will follow <br/>
the journey of an aspiring computer Geek who <br/>
wishes to master the abilty to create virtual<br/>
worlds through the art of sorcery known as coding.<br/>
Become one of my minions and I may spare your<br/>
life from the wrath of AI.....<br/>
But seriously, My name is Manuel Clavijo and as a <br/>
child I was always amazed by people's ability the<br/>
create worlds in which we would submerge our whole<br/>
beings and completely surrender ourselves to the<br/>
magic of these virtual worlds with which we could<br/>
interact with and mold as we wish.
 </p>

 <p>From the first time I heard the blissful sounds of a<br/>
dial up modem which took me through an obstacle<br/>
of sounds and screeches until eventually leading me<br>
to the phrase "You've got mail", at that moment I<br/>
told myself "Someday, I'm gonna do this computer<br/>
stuff". Well years later I found of a way to learn<br/> 
web development and an architect of worlds that<br/>
bring joy and allow people to express themselves<br/>
in the most accurate vivid ways. So I humbly ask<br/>
that you check out my work and feel free to give<br/> 
your opinion, Thanks. 
 </p>

<p>Sincerely, Manuel Clavijo...the kid that had a dream.</p>
