<h1>The best movies according to Manuel</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h3>
 <hr/>
<h3>BloodSport</h3>
 <p>I love this movie because of the way it demonstrates 
    how passion<br/> and dedication can fuel people to overcome 
    the most challenging <br/>obstacles placed before them.</p>
 <br/>
<h3>The Devil's Advocate</h3>
 <p>This a great example of how people tend to get lost due 
    to vanity<br/> and the lust for money and power.</p>
 <br/>
<h3>Saw</h3>
 <p>Watch as a maniacal villain set's people in traps as a 
    way to hold <br/>them accountable for their wrongdoings and
     allow them <br/>freedom but only at the cost of.....a piece 
     of the puzzle.</p>
